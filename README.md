# ðŸš€ Java Constructors - Practice Notes

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Constructor?

A **constructor** in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. It is called automatically when an object is created.

- Constructor name must be the **same** as the class name.
- It **does not have a return type** (not even `void`).
- It is automatically invoked at the time of object creation.

## âœ… Syntax:

```java
class ClassName {
    ClassName() {
        // Constructor body
    }
}
